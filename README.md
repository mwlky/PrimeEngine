Prime Engine is my inaugural venture into the realm of C++ game development. This project represents my humble beginnings in crafting a 2D game engine. As a novice in the world of C++ game engines, this endeavor serves as both a learning experience and a foundation for future projects. Feel free to join me on this coding journey, and let's explore the fascinating world of game development together.
